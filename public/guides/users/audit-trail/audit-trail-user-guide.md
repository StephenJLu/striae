3. **Refresh**: Close and reopen the audit viewer
4. **Check Case Number**: Ensure the case number filter is correct (if used)

### Slow Loading

**Problem**: Audit trail takes a long time to load

**Solutions:**
1. **Use Date Filters**: Select a shorter time range (like "Last 7 days")
2. **Apply Case Filter**: Focus on one specific case
3. **Check Internet**: Ensure stable connection to Cloudflare servers
4. **Close Other Tabs**: Free up browser memory

### Export Issues

**Problem**: Export files are empty or downloads fail

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Pop-ups**: Ensure your browser allows downloads from Striae
2. **Try Different Format**: If CSV fails, try JSON export

4. **Clear Browser Cache**: Refresh your browser data

### Filter Not Working

**Problem**: Filters don't seem to affect the displayed entries

**Solutions:**
1. **Press Enter or Click 'Filter'**: After typing in filter fields, click the button or press Enter to apply

3. **Use Exact Match**: Case numbers must match exactly
4. **Clear Other Filters**: Remove conflicting filters

## Best Practices

### Regular Review
- **Weekly**: Check your audit trail weekly to verify accuracy
- **Before Court**: Export relevant audit data before legal proceedings
- **After Major Work**: Review audit trail after completing significant cases

### Filter Usage
- **Start Broad**: Begin with wide date ranges, then narrow down
- **One Filter**: Use one filter type at a time for clarity
- **Document Filters**: Note which filters you used when exporting data

### Export Strategy
- **Multiple Formats**: Export in both CSV (for analysis) and JSON (for backup)
- **Regular Exports**: Export audit data monthly for your records
- **Case-Specific**: Export case-specific audit trails when closing cases

### Data Management
- **Consistent Case Numbers**: Use consistent case numbering for easier filtering
- **Meaningful Filenames**: Use descriptive filenames for easier audit trail reading
