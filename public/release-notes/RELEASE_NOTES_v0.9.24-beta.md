- **🛡️ Built-in Permission Validation** - All data operations now include mandatory access control and session validation
- **⚡ Reduced Code Duplication** - Eliminated redundant API calls across case management, confirmations, and import/export operations

### Enhanced Security & Consistency

- **🔒 Mandatory Access Controls** - All case operations require explicit permission validation preventing accidental bypasses
- **� Automatic Audit Integration** - Centralized operations include built-in audit logging and error handling
- **🎯 Type-Safe Operations** - Enhanced TypeScript integration with proper interfaces and error handling
- **�️ Consistent Error Messages** - Standardized error handling and user feedback across all operations

## 🏭 Infrastructure & Worker Enhancement

### New Audit Worker Architecture

- **⚡ Dedicated Audit Worker** - Created separate `audit-worker` for specialized audit trail processing and storage
- **� Enhanced Deployment Scripts** - Updated all installation and deployment scripts to support 7 Cloudflare Workers
- **📊 Secret Management Updates** - Enhanced deployment scripts for audit worker configuration and R2 bucket setup
- **🏗️ Separated Concerns** - Moved audit processing from data worker to dedicated audit infrastructure

### Deployment Infrastructure

- **📚 Updated Documentation** - Enhanced architecture guides, installation documentation, and developer references
- **🔧 Cross-Platform Scripts** - Updated bash, PowerShell, and batch deployment scripts for audit worker integration
- **⚡ Improved Configuration** - Enhanced worker URLs management and environment variable deployment
- **🛡️ CORS & Security Updates** - Updated security configurations for new worker architecture

## 🔍 Audit Trail System Fixes

### Filtering & Display Corrections

- **� Fixed Activity Categories** - Moved case import/export from Confirmation Activity to Case Management categories
- **🔗 Consolidated Actions** - Unified "confirm" and "confirmation-create" actions for consistent filtering behavior
- **🎯 Enhanced Filter Logic** - Corrected mapping between UI filter options and actual database audit actions
- **📝 Accurate Labeling** - Updated audit displays for forensic accuracy and proper image ID tracking

### Bug Fixes & Improvements
