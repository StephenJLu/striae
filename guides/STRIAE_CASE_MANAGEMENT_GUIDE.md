## Overview

Striae's case management system allows you to organize your forensic image analysis work into individual cases. Each case can contain multiple images, annotations, and notes, providing a structured workflow for your investigations.

### Key Features
- **Individual Case Organization**: Each case is isolated with its own images and data
- **Smart Case Numbering**: Alphanumeric case numbers with intelligent sorting
- **File Management**: Upload, organize, and delete images within cases
- **Case Operations**: Rename, delete, and transfer cases as needed
- **Batch Management**: View and manage all your cases in one place

## Getting Started

3. **Mixed Cases**: Numbers take priority over letters

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "Invalid case number format"
- **Problem**: Case number contains invalid characters
- **Solution**: Use only letters, numbers, and hyphens
- **Examples**: Remove spaces, special characters (@, !, etc.)

#### "Case already exists"
- **Problem**: Trying to rename to an existing case number
- **Solution**: Choose a different case number or load the existing case

#### "Failed to load files"
- **Problem**: Network or storage issue
- **Solutions**:
  1. Check your internet connection
  2. Refresh the page and try again
  3. Contact support if problem persists

#### "Upload failed"
- **Problem**: File upload interrupted or failed
- **Solutions**:
  1. Check file size (must be under 10MB)
  2. Verify file type is supported
  3. Check internet connection stability
  4. Try uploading again

#### "File size must be less than 10 MB"
- **Problem**: Image file is too large
- **Solutions**:
  1. Compress the image using image editing software
  2. Convert to a more efficient format (WEBP, PNG)
  3. Reduce image dimensions if appropriate for analysis

### Error Recovery

#### Auto-Recovery Features
- **Session Persistence**: Your case selection survives page refreshes
- **Error Auto-Clear**: Error messages automatically disappear
- **Upload Resume**: Failed uploads can be retried immediately
- **Data Integrity**: All operations are transaction-safe

2. **Re-login**: Ensures authentication is current
3. **Clear Browser Cache**: Resolves cached data conflicts
4. **Contact Support**: For persistent technical issues

## Best Practices

### Case Naming Conventions

#### Recommended Formats
- **Date-Based**: `2025-01-15-001` (YYYY-MM-DD-sequence)
- **Department Standard**: `PD-2025-001` (department-year-number)
- **Case Type**: `HOMICIDE-2025-001` (type-year-sequence)
- **Mixed**: `CYBER-2025-JAN-001` (type-year-month-sequence)

#### Consistency Tips
- **Use Consistent Prefixes**: Stick to one naming convention
- **Include Dates**: Years help with organization and searching
- **Sequential Numbers**: Use leading zeros (001, 002, 010)
- **Avoid Spaces**: Use hyphens instead of spaces

### File Management Best Practices

#### File Organization
- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, descriptive filenames before upload
- **Logical Order**: Upload files in the order you plan to analyze them
- **Regular Cleanup**: Remove unnecessary or duplicate files
- **Backup Important Cases**: Consider exporting critical analysis data

#### Image Quality Guidelines
- **Resolution**: Upload highest quality available for analysis
- **Format Choice**: 
  - PNG for screenshots and diagrams
  - JPEG for photographs
  - SVG for scalable graphics
- **File Size Balance**: Optimize size while maintaining analysis quality

### Workflow Recommendations

#### Efficient Case Management
1. **Plan Case Numbers**: Establish naming convention before starting
2. **Batch Operations**: Group similar cases together
3. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review and organize old cases
4. **Documentation**: Keep case notes updated throughout investigation

#### Data Security Practices
- **Regular Backups**: Export important analysis data regularly
- **Access Control**: Log out when finished working
- **Case Privacy**: Each case is isolated and private to your account
- **Secure Connections**: Always use HTTPS for case access

### Performance Optimization

#### Large Case Management
- **File Limits**: Consider breaking very large investigations into multiple cases
- **Image Optimization**: Compress images when possible without losing detail
- **Periodic Cleanup**: Delete test cases and unnecessary files
- **Network Considerations**: Upload large files during off-peak hours

#### System Efficiency
- **Browser Performance**: Use modern browsers for best experience
- **Cache Management**: Clear browser cache if experiencing slow performance
- **Connection Quality**: Stable internet connection improves reliability
- **Session Management**: Regular saves prevent data loss
