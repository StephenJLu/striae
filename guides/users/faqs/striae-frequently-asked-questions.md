## üîê Login & Authentication

**Q: How do I log into Striae for the first time?**

A: When logging into Striae for the first time, new users follow a straightforward process designed to keep your account secure. First, you'll register by providing your work email, choosing a strong password, and filling in personal details like your name and lab or company information. It‚Äôs important to make sure your organization is entered correctly. You won‚Äôt be able to change it later, unless you contact support.

After registering, an important step is verifying your email‚Äîthis confirms your identity and activates your account. Lastly, setting up two-factor authentication (MFA) with your mobile phone adds an additional security layer by requiring SMS verification codes each time you log in. This approach ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive forensic data.

**Q: What are the password requirements for Striae?**

A: For maximum security, Striae enforces strong password rules. Your password must be at least 10 characters long and include a mix of capital letters, numbers, and special characters such as !@#$%^&\*. This complexity helps protect your account from unauthorized access, aligning with industry best practices for safeguarding forensic and case data.

**Q: Why is two-factor authentication required?**

A: Two-factor authentication (MFA) is crucial because it significantly enhances your account‚Äôs security. With MFA enabled, even if someone knows your password, they cannot log in without also having access to your registered phone to receive SMS verification codes. Because Striae handles sensitive forensic information, complying with strict security standards is essential. MFA helps prevent unauthorized access and protects the integrity of your case management.

## üìä Case Management

**Q: How do I start working on a new case?**

A: Getting started with a new case in Striae is simple and intuitive. Begin by using the case management panel on the left sidebar after logging in. You can either create a completely new case or load one you‚Äôve worked on before. Once the case is active, upload images that relate to your evidence files. After your images are uploaded and selected, you can start adding detailed annotations. The ‚ÄúImage Notes‚Äù section is where you enter case-specific information and descriptive annotations, helping organize your evidence clearly and professionally.

**Q: What file formats does Striae support for images?**

A: Striae supports the most common and reliable image formats used in forensic documentation, including PNG and JPEG. PNG is recommended especially for screenshots or images requiring sharp detail, while JPEG is ideal for photographs with gradients or complex textures. The system also supports GIF, WEBP, and SVG formats. To maintain smooth operation, Striae suggests keeping image file sizes under 10MB to ensure quick uploads and efficient processing.

## ÔøΩ Case Import & Review System

**Q: How do I import a case that was shared with me?**

A: To import a shared case, use the "Import Case" feature in the case management panel. Click "Import Case" and select the ZIP file that was shared with you (this should be a complete case export from another Striae user). Only ZIP files (.zip) exported from Striae are accepted for security reasons. Once uploaded, the system will extract and import all case data, images, and annotations. The imported case will be added to your case list and you can immediately start reviewing the annotations and data.

**Q: What happens when I import a case - can I edit it?**

A: Imported cases are automatically set to **read-only mode** to preserve the integrity of the original work. You can view all annotations, images, case details, and generate PDF reports, but you cannot modify any of the data, annotations, or upload new images. This read-only protection ensures that imported forensic evidence maintains its original state for chain of custody and audit purposes. If you need to work with similar data, create a new case instead.

**Q: Can I tell if a case was imported from someone else?**

A: Yes! Imported cases are clearly marked with a special "Read-Only" badge in the case management panel and throughout the interface. Additionally, you'll see read-only indicators on all editing features, and the case review panel will display "Read-Only Mode" status. This visual distinction helps you immediately identify which cases are your original work versus cases that were shared with you.

**Q: What's included when I import a case ZIP file?**

A: When you import a case ZIP file, you receive the complete case package including all original images, comprehensive annotation data (all 22 data fields), box annotations with precise coordinates and colors, case metadata and timestamps, and file organization exactly as it was in the original case. The import process preserves all visual elements, classifications, support levels, and detailed notes to maintain complete forensic documentation.

**Q: Why can't I import other file types besides ZIP files?**

A: Striae only accepts ZIP files for case import to ensure security and data integrity. ZIP files from Striae exports contain a verified structure with all necessary components (images, data files, metadata) in a standardized format. This restriction prevents potential security issues from unknown file types and ensures that only legitimate Striae case exports can be imported, maintaining the chain of custody for forensic evidence.

**Q: What should I do if my case import fails?**

A: If case import fails, first verify that you're uploading a valid ZIP file exported from Striae. Check that the file isn't corrupted and that you have a stable internet connection. The system will display specific error messages to help diagnose the issue. Common problems include invalid file formats (ensure it's a .zip file), corrupted ZIP files, or network connectivity issues. If problems persist, try importing the case again or contact support with details about the error message.

## ÔøΩüì§ Case Data Export

**Q: How do I export my case data from Striae?**

A: Striae offers comprehensive case export functionality with multiple format options. To export a single case, enter the case number in the case management panel, select your preferred format (JSON, CSV, or Excel), and click "Export Case Data." For bulk exports, choose your format and click "Export All Cases" to download all your cases at once. The system provides real-time progress tracking and automatically generates properly named files for easy organization.

**Q: What export formats are available and when should I use each?**

A: Striae supports three export formats, each optimized for different use cases:

- **JSON Format**: Choose this for technical analysis, database integration, or when you need structured data with complete hierarchy preservation. JSON provides the most compact file size and maintains all data relationships.

- **CSV Format**: Ideal for single case exports when you need spreadsheet analysis. CSV files include all 22 annotation fields in organized columns, perfect for Excel, Google Sheets, or statistical analysis tools like R.

- **Excel Format**: Best for bulk exports involving multiple cases. Excel files feature organized worksheets with summary statistics and individual case details, plus built-in analysis and formatting capabilities.

**Note**: When you choose to include images with your export, the system automatically packages everything in a ZIP file containing both the data files and all original images, regardless of which format you select.

**Q: What data is included in exported case files?**

A: All export formats include identical, comprehensive data to ensure complete documentation:

- Complete annotation information (all 22 data fields including case identifiers, visual elements, classifications, and options)
- Box annotation details with precise coordinates and visual properties
- Case metadata including file information, upload dates, and case statistics
- Export tracking information and error handling details
- Timestamps and user attribution for accountability
- File IDs, original filenames, and complete annotation data for each file in the case

**Q: Can I export all my cases at once?**

A: Yes! The bulk export feature allows you to export all your cases in a single operation. Choose between JSON format (single comprehensive file) or Excel format (multi-worksheet file with summary data). The system provides real-time progress tracking showing "Exporting case X of Y: [Case Name]" and continues processing even if individual cases encounter errors. Large exports with many cases may take several minutes to complete.

**Q: How does the progress tracking work during bulk exports?**

A: Striae provides comprehensive progress monitoring during bulk exports. You'll see a real-time progress bar showing completion percentage, a case counter displaying which case is currently being processed, and detailed status updates. The system handles errors gracefully‚Äîfailed cases are noted but don't stop the export process, ensuring you get complete data for all accessible cases.

**Q: What are the file naming conventions for exports?**

A: Striae uses intelligent, descriptive file naming to keep your exports organized:

- **Single Case JSON**: `striae-case-export-[CASE-NUMBER]-[DATE].json`
- **Single Case CSV**: `striae-case-export-[CASE-NUMBER]-[DATE].csv`
- **Single Case with Images**: `striae-case-export-[CASE-NUMBER]-[DATE].zip` (contains data files + images)
- **Bulk JSON**: `striae-all-cases-export-[DATE].json`
- **Bulk Excel**: `striae-all-cases-detailed-[DATE].xlsx`

All files include timestamps to prevent naming conflicts and ensure proper version control.

**Q: My export seems stuck or slow. What should I do?**

A: Export speed depends on several factors. For stuck exports, first check your internet connection and wait for the current case to complete processing. If the export appears frozen, refresh the page and try again. Large bulk exports with many cases naturally take longer. Ensure you have a stable, high-speed internet connection for optimal performance.

**Q: The export download didn't start. How do I fix this?**

A: Download issues are usually browser-related. Check your browser's download settings and permissions, ensuring popup blockers aren't preventing downloads. Try using a different browser if issues persist‚ÄîChrome is recommended for best compatibility. Clear your browser cache or try an incognito/private window if problems continue.

**Q: Can I export cases that don't have any annotations?**

A: Yes, Striae will export all cases regardless of whether they contain annotations. Cases without annotations will still include file information, case metadata, and basic case details. The export system distinguishes between cases with and without annotations in the summary data, providing complete documentation of your case portfolio.

**Q: How do ZIP exports work and what's included?**

A: ZIP exports are created automatically when you choose to include images with your case export. Regardless of whether you select JSON or CSV format, checking the "Include Images" option will package your selected data format along with all original case images into a comprehensive ZIP archive file.

**Q: What's the structure of a ZIP export file?**

A: When you include images in your export, the ZIP file is organized for easy navigation:

- **Data Files**: Your selected format (JSON or CSV) is included in the root directory
- **Images Folder**: All original case images are organized in a dedicated `images/` directory within the ZIP
- **README File**: A helpful text file explaining the contents and structure of the export
- **Organized Layout**: Files are clearly named and structured for immediate use and archiving

**Q: Can I choose whether to include images in my export?**

A: Yes! For single case exports, you'll see a checkbox option labeled "Include Images." When unchecked, you'll receive your data in the selected format (JSON or CSV) as a single file. When checked, the system automatically creates a ZIP package containing both your data file and all case images in an organized structure.

**Q: How long do exports with images take?**

A: Export time depends on the number and size of images in your case. Cases with just a few small images may complete in seconds, while cases with many images may take several minutes. The system provides real-time progress updates showing download progress for images and ZIP file creation. Ensure you have a stable internet connection for the best experience.

**Q: What happens if some images fail to download during export with images?**

A: Striae handles image download failures gracefully. If some images can't be downloaded (due to network issues or file problems), the export will still complete with the available images and data files. A detailed error log in the ZIP file will indicate which images couldn't be included, so you can identify and potentially retry downloading specific files if needed.

**Q: Are there any file size limits for exports with images?**

A: While individual images are limited to 10MB during upload, the total export file size depends on how many images are in your case. Cases with many large images will create correspondingly large ZIP files. Most browsers can handle ZIP files up to several hundred megabytes, but very large cases may take longer to download. Consider your internet connection speed when exporting cases with many large images.

**Q: Can I use exports with images for audits, legal proceedings, or evidence sharing?**

A: Absolutely! Exports with images are ideal for audits or legal proceedings because they provide complete case documentation in a single, organized package. The structured format with original images and comprehensive data makes it easy to share complete evidence packages with auditors, attorneys, or other forensic examiners. The inclusion of both data formats ensures compatibility with various analysis tools and documentation requirements.

**Q: Is there a limit to how many cases I can export at once?**

A: There's no specific limit to the number of cases you can export simultaneously. However, very large exports (hundreds of cases) may take considerable time to process and could be affected by browser timeout limitations.

**Q: Can I import case data?**

A: No. Data import functionality is not permitted to ensure the integrity and security of forensic data stored with Striae. Imported data could introduce inconsistencies or compromise chain-of-custody, so Striae focuses solely on secure case creation, management, and annotation within the platform only.

## üéØ Image Annotation

**Q: What types of annotations can I add to my images?**

A: Striae offers a rich set of six annotation tools designed specifically for firearms examination and forensic comparison. You can add case and item numbers to image corners for clear identification. Class characteristics allow you to document technical details like land impressions or primer shear. Index marks let you highlight the specific comparison point shown in the selected image using colorful borders or alphanumeric labels. The support level tool captures your analytical conclusion‚Äîwhether the evidence supports identification, exclusion, or remains inconclusive. There‚Äôs also a confirmation field for adding reviewer signatures and dates in identifications. Box annotations allow you to draw colored rectangles around specific areas of interest. Finally, the additional notes tool enables you to record detailed observations that provide further context.

**Q: Can I preview my annotations before creating the PDF report?**

A: Absolutely! The annotation toolbar makes it easy to toggle each annotation type on or off in real time. This way, you can see exactly how your final PDF will look while you work, ensuring that everything is properly displayed according to your documentation needs before you generate the report.

**Q: What‚Äôs the difference between Color Index and Number/Letter Index?**

A: Both tools serve to visually mark comparison points, but they do so differently. The Color Index surrounds the entire image with a distinctive colored border, which makes it very clear and immediately recognizable. This method is recommended when you want strong visual emphasis. The Number/Letter Index displays alphanumeric identifiers above the image, which can be useful for referencing specific comparison areas more precisely in your notes. Both systems help maintain clarity and assist in peer review or courtroom presentation.

**Q: How do I use box annotations to highlight specific areas?**

A: Box annotations allow you to draw colored rectangular highlights directly on your images to emphasize specific areas of interest. First, click the Box tool in the annotation toolbar to activate box drawing mode. A color picker will appear, allowing you to select from multiple colors. Then simply click and drag on the image to draw a rectangular box around the area you want to highlight. You can delete boxes after creation by right-clicking or double-clicking them if you've made a mistake. This tool is particularly useful for pointing out specific striae, class characteristics, or other significant comparison points.

**Q: Can I use multiple colors for different box annotations on the same image?**

A: Yes! You can use multiple colors for different box annotations on the same image. Each time you activate the Box tool, you can select a different color from the color picker before drawing. This allows you to color-code different types of features‚Äîfor example, you might use red boxes for aligned striae and blue boxes for firing pin impressions. All box annotations, regardless of color, are preserved in the PDF output with their exact colors and positions.

**Q: Can I remove or edit box annotations after I've drawn them?**

A: Absolutely! Box annotations are deletable after creation. Simply right-click or double-click on the box to delete it. You can also hide all box annotations using the Box tool button in the toolbar without permanently deleting them. They won't be visible in the PDF if the Box tool is toggled off, but they remain saved in your case for future reference.

**Q: Will my box annotations appear in the PDF report?**

A: Yes, all box annotations are preserved in the PDF output with the same colors and positions as shown on screen. Make sure the Box tool is toggled on in the annotation toolbar before generating your PDF to ensure the boxes appear in your report. The boxes will be displayed as colored rectangular overlays on your image, maintaining their exact placement and colors for professional documentation and presentation.

**Q: Is my original image edited to include the box annotations?**

A: No! Your original image remains unaltered. The box annotations are overlaid on the image in the canvas and during the PDF generation process, but they do *not* modify the original file. This means you can always revert to the unannotated image if needed. Striae does not edit or change your original images in any way, ensuring the integrity of your evidence files is maintained. This holds true for all annotation types, including case numbers, class characteristics, index marks, and support level indicators; they are stored in a separate data structure and rendered dynamically without altering the original images.

## üìÑ PDF Generation

**Q: How do I generate a professional PDF report?**

A: Generating a polished, case-ready PDF with Striae is straightforward. First, make sure all your annotation data is complete and saved. Use the toolbar to enable only the annotations you wish to include in the report. Then click the Print icon, which initiates the generation process. It usually takes between 15 to 60 seconds, depending on the amount of data. The PDF automatically downloads with a smart, descriptive filename that reflects your case details, ready for printing or saving.

**Q: How does Striae decide what filename to give the PDF?**

A: Filenames are automatically generated to keep reports well-organized and easy to identify. If you‚Äôre making a comparison between two cases, the filename will include both case numbers and item identifiers, for example: `striae-report-2025-001-1A--2025-002-1B.pdf`. For single case reports, it uses the case and item numbers, like `striae-report-2025-001-1A.pdf`. When only the case number is available, it simplifies to `striae-report-2025-001.pdf`. If no case information exists, a timestamp-based filename ensures uniqueness. Invalid characters are automatically sanitized for compatibility.

**Q: What information is included in the PDF reports?**

A: Striae‚Äôs PDFs are professionally formatted to include everything necessary for thorough case documentation. You‚Äôll find the current date and case details in the header. The main image is shown in full resolution, overlaid with selected annotations like case numbers, class characteristics, index marks, and your support level conclusion. Additional notes and observations appear if provided. For identifications, a confirmation signature area is included to meet documentation standards for technical review.

## üë§ Account Deletion

**Q: How do I delete my Striae account?**

A: To delete your account, go to your user profile page and click the red "Delete Striae Account" button. Deleting your account will permanently remove all your account data, including your user profile, cases, images, annotations, and files. The process is irreversible, so make sure you've archived or downloaded any reports or data you want to keep before proceeding.

**Q: What happens when I delete my account?**

A: Account deletion is comprehensive and permanent. All your account information is removed from our systems. Every case you've created is deleted along with all associated images, annotations, and data files. Your email address is also permanently disabled to prevent any future account creation with the same email. You'll receive a confirmation email once the deletion is complete.

**Q: Can I recover my account after deletion?**

A: No, account deletion is irreversible. Once you confirm the deletion, all your data is permanently removed from Striae's systems and cannot be recovered. If you think you might need your data later, be sure to download any important reports or export your case information before deleting your account.

**Q: Will I get a confirmation that my account was deleted?**

A: Yes, a confirmation email is sent to you confirming your account has been successfully deleted, and an administrative notification is sent to our support team. The email will include details about what was removed and will confirm that your email address has been disabled for future registrations.

**Q: How long does the deletion process take?**

A: Account deletion is immediate and typically completes within a few seconds. You'll receive the confirmation email shortly after the process finishes. The deletion includes removing all your cases, images, and files from our storage systems, so larger accounts may take slightly longer to process completely. Any multi-factor authentication phone numbers you used when you registered your account may take a few days to be disabled.

## üîß Troubleshooting

**Q: I see an error saying "Cannot generate PDF - no image selected." What should I do?**

A: This usually means you‚Äôve tried to generate a PDF without selecting an image. To fix it, first confirm you‚Äôve loaded a case that contains uploaded images. Then click on a specific image so it appears in the viewer. After verifying the image is visible, you can generate the PDF successfully.

**Q: Why aren‚Äôt my annotations appearing in my PDF report?**

A: If your annotations don‚Äôt show up, double-check that you‚Äôve saved all your annotation data within the "Image Notes" panel. Also, ensure the correct annotation tools are toggled on in the toolbar before generating the PDF. Missing required fields or working on an unselected image can also cause this issue, so verify those carefully.

**Q: The PDF download isn‚Äôt starting after I click print. How do I fix that?**

A: This may be due to browser restrictions. First, check your browser‚Äôs settings to allow file downloads from the Striae site. Disable any pop-up blockers that might prevent automatic downloads. Clearing your browser cache can also solve this problem. If issues persist, try switching to a different browser‚ÄîChrome is generally recommended for best results.

**Q: Which browsers work best with Striae?**

A: For the smoothest experience, use Chrome, which offers the best performance and compatibility. Firefox is another solid choice with good support for modern web features. Microsoft Edge supports all Striae functionality as well. Safari works but with some advanced features possibly behaving differently.

***

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Best Practices

**Q: How should I handle my login credentials securely?**

A: It‚Äôs best practice to use unique, strong passwords for your Striae account and not share them with anyone. A trusted password manager can help you generate and store complex passwords securely. Always log out when you finish your session, especially if you are on a shared or public computer. Regularly update your password to maintain account security.

**Q: What should be included in professional forensic documentation?**

A: Your documentation should follow your department‚Äôs standards for case numbering and use accurate, technical terminology for class characteristics. Detailed observations are essential for peer review, so include sufficient information to support your conclusions. When identifying evidence, enable the confirmation field to include a signature and review date. Use consistent indexing methods throughout the case for clarity.

**Q: How can I best organize my PDF reports?**

A: To maintain order, let Striae‚Äôs automatic filename generation handle your report naming consistently. Organize your reports into folders by case or date for easy retrieval. Keep backup copies in secure, backed-up storage that complies with your department‚Äôs retention policies. Maintaining version control with dated PDFs helps you track any changes over time.
