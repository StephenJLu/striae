## Overview

Striae's annotation and PDF generation system allows forensic examiners to create professional documentation of firearms comparison analyses. The system provides comprehensive annotation tools and generates high-quality PDF reports suitable for court documentation and case files.

### Key Features

- **Visual Annotation Tools**: Add case numbers, class characteristics, index marks, and support levels directly on images
- **Professional PDF Output**: Generate court-ready reports with automatic formatting
- **Flexible Annotation System**: Toggle annotations on/off for different viewing needs  
- **Smart Filename Generation**: Automatic PDF naming based on case information
- **Real-time Preview**: See annotations as you work on the image

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Active Case**: You must have a case loaded with at least one image
2. **Image Selected**: An image must be loaded in the viewer
3. **Notes Configured**: Basic annotation data should be entered

### Accessing the Annotation System

1. **Load a Case**: Use the case management panel to select your working case
2. **Upload/Select Image**: Choose an image from your case files
3. **Access Image Notes**: Click "Image Notes" to configure annotation data
4. **Use Toolbar**: The annotation toolbar appears above the image viewer

## Image Annotation Process

### Step 1: Configure Basic Information

Before annotating, set up your basic case information:

1. **Click "Image Notes"** to open the notes sidebar
2. **Enter Case Information**:
   - Left Side Case # (e.g., "2025-001")
   - Left Side Item # (e.g., "1A", "Evidence #1") 
   - Right Side Case # (e.g., "2025-002")
   - Right Side Item # (e.g., "1B", "K1")
3. **Select Font Color**: Choose visibility color for case numbers
4. **Save Notes**: Click "Save Notes" to store your configuration

### Step 2: Set Class Characteristics

Define the type of evidence being compared:

1. **Select Object Type**:
   - **Bullet**: For projectile comparisons
   - **Cartridge Case**: For fired cartridge case analysis
   - **Other**: For custom object types (specify in text field)

2. **Add Class Notes**: Describe observable class characteristics
   - Examples: "9mm Luger", ".45 ACP", "6 lands and grooves, right twist"

3. **Subclass Option**: Check if potential subclass characteristics are present
   - This adds a flashing warning indicator in the annotation system

### Step 3: Configure Index System

Choose how to mark specific comparison points:

#### Color Index (Recommended)
- **Select "Color" option**
- **Choose Index Color**: Pick a distinct color for marking comparison points
- **Visual Indication**: Creates a colored border around the entire image

#### Number/Letter Index
- **Select "Number/Letter" option** 
- **Enter Index Value**: Type alphanumeric identifier (e.g., "1", "A", "1A")
- **Display Position**: Shows prominently above the image

### Step 4: Set Support Level

Define your analytical conclusion:

- **Identification**: High degree of scientific certainty
- **Exclusion**: Evidence originated from different source
- **Inconclusive**: Insufficient detail for definitive conclusion

**Note**: Selecting "Identification" automatically enables the confirmation field for tech review signatures.

### Step 5: Add Additional Notes (Optional)

For detailed observations or complex analyses:

1. **Click "Additional Notes"**
2. **Enter Detailed Information**: 
   - Specific observations
   - Measurement details
   - Technical notes for peer review
3. **Save**: Notes appear in the final PDF report
