## Striae Development Indefinitely Suspended

*Updated August 15, 2025*

Some of you know that at the end of 2024, I’d been working on a personal project close to my heart — **Striae**, a *Firearms Examiner’s Comparison Companion*.

The goal was simple but powerful: give firearms examiners a secure, organized way to **upload bullet and cartridge case comparison images**, link them to specific cases, and make **notations directly tied to each image**.

**Core Features I built:**
- User login & account management
- Case management for organized workflows
- Upload images tied to cases
- Make and store notations linked to each specific image

**Security Measures baked in from day one:**
- 🔐 Firebase Authentication for login and admin management
- 🔐 Encryption in transit and at rest
- 🔐 Data segregation/isolation
- 🔐 Controlled access & monitoring

Unfortunately, a few significant life upheavals forced me to pause development before reaching the **printing tools and live display functions** I had envisioned.

Rather than let it fade away in a private, closed folder, I’ve **opened the code archive to the public**. Every project that I had built in the previous few years has been founded on the principle of contributing to the public good. My hope is that someone with the skills and interest might pick up where I left off — improve it, adapt it, and maybe even take *Striae* further than I imagined. If that sounds like you (or you know someone who'd be interested), the code is now available for anyone to view and build upon. If circumstances allow, I may resume development in the future and take this to the finish line.
